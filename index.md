I’m working as a Data Scientist for the Department of Defense, developing tools and techniques to enable data driven insights for performance and efficiencies.

I studied Physics and Computer Science at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville Tennessee, where I focused my undergraduate research on high altitude balloons. My research later took me to an internship at NASA's Balloon Research and Development Lab on Wallops Island Virginia. I focused Linear low-density polyethylene material properties in various conditions during flight.

Living in Virginia I spent 2 years working as Data Science Consultant for Booz Allen Hamilton, where I split my time between Air Force, Navy, and NASA clients. Developing anything from complex Microsoft Excel functionality to multivariate clustering algorithms for fortran code analysis.

My current technical interests are with web-based applications, data visualization, natural language processing, and graph theory.
